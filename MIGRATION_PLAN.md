# Migration Plan: From SSO Branch to Vanilla Campfire + Small Bets Mods

## Current State
- **Current Branch:** `feature/sso` - Contains OpenID Connect integration
- **Clean Branch:** `main` - Vanilla Once Campfire
- **Goal:** Start fresh with vanilla Campfire and add Small Bets modifications

---

## Step 1: Preserve SSO Branch

Your SSO work is safely committed on `feature/sso`. You can always return to it later.

```bash
# Verify SSO branch is committed
git checkout feature/sso
git status

# Tag it for easy reference (optional)
git tag sso-implementation-v1
git push origin sso-implementation-v1
```

---

## Step 2: Create New Development Branch

Start from vanilla Campfire (main branch):

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Create new branch for modifications
git checkout -b feature/smallbets-mods
```

---

## Step 3: Add Small Bets Remote

```bash
# Add Small Bets repository as remote
git remote add smallbets https://github.com/antiwork/smallbets.git

# Fetch their branches
git fetch smallbets

# View their commits
git log smallbets/master --oneline | head -20
```

## Step 5: Cherry-Pick Process

For each feature:

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-counter

# 2. View the commit
git show smallbets/master:<commit-hash>

# 3. Cherry-pick the commit
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# 4. If conflicts occur
git status
# Resolve conflicts manually
git add .
git cherry-pick --continue

# 5. Test thoroughly
rails test
# Manual testing in browser

# 6. Commit if you made changes
git commit -m "Add user counter feature from Small Bets"

# 7. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/user-counter

# 8. Merge to feature/smallbets-mods after approval
git checkout feature/smallbets-mods
git merge feature/user-counter
```

---

## Step 6: Manual Integration (Recommended)

For complex features, manually integrate rather than cherry-picking:

```bash
# 1. View the changes online
# Go to: https://github.com/antiwork/smallbets/commit/<commit-hash>

# 2. Create new files or modify existing ones based on the diff

# 3. Test and commit your version
git add .
git commit -m "Implement bookmarks feature (inspired by Small Bets)"
```

---

## Step 7: Testing Strategy

After each feature:

1. **Unit Tests**
   ```bash
   rails test
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test the feature in isolation
   - Test interactions with other features

3. **Manual Testing**
   - Test in development environment
   - Test on Railway (staging)

4. **User Acceptance**
   - Deploy to production
   - Gather feedback

---

## Step 8: Documentation

For each feature added:

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
2. Document any new environment variables
3. Update API documentation if applicable
4. Add to README if user-facing

---

## Step 9: Database Migrations

Some features require database changes:

```bash
# Check for migrations in commits
git show <commit-hash> --stat | grep db/migrate

# Create new migration if needed
rails generate migration AddFeatureName

# Run migrations
rails db:migrate

# Test rollback
rails db:rollback
rails db:migrate
```

---

## Step 10: Deployment Process

```bash
# 1. Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/smallbets-mods

# 2. Tag release
git tag -a v1.0.0-smallbets -m "Vanilla Campfire + Small Bets mods"

# 3. Push to production
git push origin main --tags

# 4. Run migrations on production
# In Railway dashboard or via CLI
rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
```

---

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Switch between branches
git checkout feature/sso              # Your SSO work
git checkout feature/smallbets-mods   # New development
git checkout main                     # Vanilla Campfire

# View commits
git log smallbets/master --oneline --graph

# Compare branches
git diff main feature/smallbets-mods

# Cherry-pick specific commit
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Cherry-pick range of commits
git cherry-pick <start-hash>..<end-hash>

# Abort cherry-pick if issues
git cherry-pick --abort

# View file from another branch
git show smallbets/master:path/to/file.rb
```

---

## Features to Skip

These conflict with your use case or aren't needed:

1. **Email-based Auth** - You'll use OIDC instead
2. Any password-related changes - OIDC handles auth

---

## When to Return to SSO

If you need SSO functionality later:

```bash
# Option 1: Cherry-pick SSO commits into new branch
git checkout feature/smallbets-mods
git cherry-pick <sso-commit-hashes>

# Option 2: Merge SSO branch
git checkout feature/smallbets-mods
git merge feature/sso
# Resolve conflicts

# Option 3: Rebase SSO on top of new work
git checkout feature/sso
git rebase feature/smallbets-mods
```

---

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Review this plan
2. âœ… Tag SSO branch for safekeeping
3. âœ… Create `feature/smallbets-mods` branch
4. âœ… Add Small Bets remote
5. âœ… Start with Phase 1 features
6. Test, commit, deploy!

---

## Notes

- Take it one feature at a time
- Test thoroughly after each addition
- Document as you go
- Don't rush - quality over speed
- Keep SSO branch for reference
- You can always merge SSO back later

Good luck with the migration! ðŸš€
