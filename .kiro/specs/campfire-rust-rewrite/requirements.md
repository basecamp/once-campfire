# Requirements Document - MVP Phase 1

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the **Revolutionary MVP** of rewriting the existing Ruby on Rails Campfire chat application using **Interface-Stub Architecture** - a paradigm shift from narrative specifications to executable blueprints that enable 95% codebase compression and 10x productivity through LLM-driven development.

**Strategic Innovation: Interface-Stub Architecture with UIGS**
- **95-99% Compression**: Replace traditional codebases with executable JSONL specifications
- **Pre-Code Analysis**: Catch 80-90% of issues before implementation
- **LLM Translation**: Perfect specs ‚Üí Perfect code (not interpretation)
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proofs of correctness

**Core Philosophy**: Treat specifications as mathematical truths, LLMs as deterministic compilers, and verification as automated proof.

**Primary Goals:**
- **Revolutionary Productivity**: 10x improvement through spec-first automation
- **Correct-by-Construction**: Mathematical certainty through executable specifications
- **95% Cost Reduction**: Dramatic infrastructure and maintenance savings
- **Anti-Coordination Simplicity**: Single binary with zero coordination overhead
- **Evidence-Based Evolution**: Add complexity only when proven necessary

## MVP 1.0 Strategic Focus

### Complete UI with Text-Only Backend (Included in MVP 1.0)
- ‚úÖ **Complete React UI** - All components, styling, and interactions (26 CSS files)
- ‚úÖ **Rich text messaging** - Trix editor with HTML formatting, sounds, boosts
- ‚úÖ **Real-time features** - WebSocket broadcasting, presence, typing notifications
- ‚úÖ **Room management** - Open/Closed/Direct rooms with membership controls
- ‚úÖ **Authentication** - Session management, bot integration, role-based access
- ‚úÖ **Search functionality** - FTS5-powered message search
- ‚úÖ **Push notifications** - Web Push with VAPID keys
- ‚úÖ **Sound system** - 59 embedded MP3 files with /play commands

### Gracefully Deferred to v2.0 (Future Enhancement)
- üö´ **File attachments** - Complete UI shown with "Coming in v2.0" messaging
- üö´ **Avatar uploads** - Text-based initials with upload UI for future
- üö´ **OpenGraph previews** - Link detection with placeholder for future unfurling

**MVP Scope:** Campfire is a web-based chat application that supports multiple rooms with access controls, direct messages, rich text messaging, search, notifications via Web Push, @mentions, and API support for bot integrations. File attachments, avatars, and OpenGraph previews are **gracefully disabled** with clear upgrade messaging.

**Architecture Approach:** Simple 3-layer monolith (Database ‚Üí API ‚Üí WebSocket) with embedded React SPA, direct SQLite operations, and Rails-inspired patterns for real-time functionality.

## Technical Architecture Context

The simplified MVP implementation includes these core components:
- **Database**: Direct SQLite operations with FTS5 virtual table for message search
- **Real-time**: ActionCable-inspired WebSocket broadcasting (simple, proven patterns)
- **Authentication**: Rails-style session management with secure tokens and bot API keys
- **Push Notifications**: Web Push with VAPID keys for message notifications
- **Frontend**: Complete React UI with simple state management (no cross-tab coordination)
- **Background Jobs**: Simple async tasks for webhook delivery and push notifications
- **Security**: Basic rate limiting, input validation, content sanitization

**Architecture Philosophy:**
- **Rails Compatibility**: Replicate Rails ActionCable behavior, not improve it
- **Simple Patterns**: Use proven Rails patterns implemented in idiomatic Rust
- **No Coordination Complexity**: Direct operations, no global event sequencing
- **Evidence-Based**: Add complexity only when Rails proves it's necessary

**Deferred to Future Phases:**
- File Storage: Active Storage with blob storage, image/video processing
- Avatar uploads and image processing
- OpenGraph link unfurling and preview generation
- Advanced coordination (only if Rails analysis proves necessary)

## Hard Constraints - Anti-Coordination Mandates

**CRITICAL: These constraints are MANDATORY for MVP Phase 1 to prevent coordination complexity madness:**

### üö´ **FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** (Will cause immediate spec rejection)
- **NO coordination layers, coordinators, or event buses**
- **NO distributed transactions, sagas, or event sourcing**
- **NO circuit breakers, retry queues, or complex error recovery**
- **NO cross-tab coordination or global state synchronization**
- **NO microservices, service mesh, or distributed architecture**
- **NO message queues, event streams, or async coordination**
- **NO complex state machines or coordination protocols**

### ‚úÖ **MANDATORY SIMPLICITY PATTERNS**
- **Direct SQLite operations** - Simple INSERT/UPDATE/SELECT queries
- **Basic WebSocket broadcasting** - Direct room-based message sending
- **Rails-style session management** - Simple cookie-based authentication
- **Simple error handling** - Basic Result<T, E> with user-friendly messages
- **Direct function calls** - No async coordination between components
- **Single binary deployment** - No orchestration or service discovery

### üìè **COMPLEXITY LIMITS**
- **Maximum 50 total files** in entire codebase (backend + frontend)
- **No file over 500 lines** - Split large files into smaller modules
- **Maximum 3 async operations per request** - Keep request handling simple
- **No more than 2 levels of error handling** - Avoid nested Result chains
- **Single database connection pool** - No distributed data management

### üéØ **RAILS PARITY RULE**
- **If Rails doesn't do it, we don't do it** - Use Rails as the complexity ceiling
- **Replicate Rails patterns exactly** - Don't "improve" on proven Rails behavior
- **Evidence-based additions only** - New patterns require Rails precedent
- **Simple beats clever** - Choose obvious solutions over optimized ones

## Requirements

### Requirement 0: Anti-Coordination Architecture Enforcement (MVP Phase 1)

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want absolute assurance that the MVP implementation remains simple and Rails-equivalent, so that we avoid coordination complexity that increases costs, development time, and system fragility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component is implemented THEN it SHALL use direct function calls instead of async coordination, implement single-threaded logic where possible, avoid global state management, and replicate Rails patterns exactly
2. WHEN database operations occur THEN they SHALL use direct SQLite queries with basic connection pooling, avoid distributed transactions or coordination, implement simple INSERT/UPDATE/SELECT patterns, and maintain Rails-equivalent data access patterns
3. WHEN WebSocket functionality is implemented THEN it SHALL use basic room-based broadcasting like Rails ActionCable, avoid complex message ordering or delivery guarantees, implement simple connection management, and provide basic presence tracking without coordination
4. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL use simple Result<T, E> patterns, provide user-friendly error messages, avoid complex retry logic or circuit breakers, and implement basic logging without coordination overhead
5. WHEN real-time features are added THEN they SHALL replicate Rails ActionCable behavior exactly, avoid event sourcing or complex state management, use direct WebSocket sends to room subscribers, and maintain simple connection state
6. WHEN background tasks are needed THEN they SHALL use basic tokio::spawn for simple async tasks, avoid message queues or complex job systems, implement direct webhook delivery, and maintain Rails-equivalent background job simplicity
7. WHEN authentication is implemented THEN it SHALL use Rails-style session cookies, avoid complex OAuth flows or token management, implement basic bcrypt password hashing, and maintain simple session state management
8. WHEN the codebase grows THEN it SHALL maintain maximum 50 total files, keep individual files under 500 lines, avoid deep module hierarchies, and prioritize readability over optimization
9. WHEN performance optimization is considered THEN it SHALL use Rust's natural performance benefits, avoid premature optimization or complex caching, maintain simple database queries, and focus on Rails-equivalent functionality first
10. WHEN any "improvement" over Rails is proposed THEN it SHALL be rejected unless it provides direct cost reduction, maintains identical user experience, requires no additional complexity, and has clear evidence of necessity
11. WHEN code review occurs THEN it SHALL verify compliance with anti-coordination constraints, check for forbidden patterns, ensure Rails parity, and reject any coordination complexity regardless of perceived benefits
12. WHEN deployment is implemented THEN it SHALL use single binary with embedded assets, avoid orchestration or service discovery, maintain simple environment configuration, and provide basic health checks without coordination overhead

## Strategic Prioritization: Interface-Stub First

**Governing Principle**: The revolutionary Interface-Stub Architecture takes priority over traditional feature implementation. We focus on the core innovation first, then use it to generate the complete feature set.

### Phase 1: MVP Core (Interface-Stub + 3x3 Graph)
**Primary Focus**: Implement the revolutionary architecture that enables 95% compression
- **JSONL Specifications**: Executable type/function/trait definitions
- **3x3 Graph Structure**: Basic Calls/Implements/Interacts edges
- **SigHash IDs**: BLAKE3-based stable identifiers
- **Basic CLI Tool**: who-calls, blast-radius analysis

### Phase 2: Core Chat Functionality
**Secondary Priority**: Essential chat features using Interface-Stub specs
- **Message deduplication** (Gap #1)
- **WebSocket reconnection** (Gap #2)
- **Write serialization** (Gap #3)
- **Session security** (Gap #4)
- **Presence tracking** (Gap #5)

### Phase 3: Feature Generation
**Tertiary Priority**: Use Interface-Stub to generate remaining features
- **Sound system** (56 effects)
- **Advanced UI components**
- **File attachments**
- **Search functionality**

**Key Insight**: The Interface-Stub Architecture makes traditional implementation obsolete. Instead of manually implementing 1,503 lines of requirements, we create executable specifications that generate the complete system.

## 5 Critical Gaps That Must Be Solved

**Governing Thought (Minto Apex)**: These gaps represent the only coordination complexity we accept - each has proven Rails solutions that we replicate exactly, avoiding over-engineering while ensuring reliability.

## Interface-Stub Architecture: Executable Specifications

**Philosophy**: This specification implements **Interface-Stub Architecture** - compressing architectural intent into 1-2% JSONL specifications that define requirements, types, operations, constraints, and non-functional requirements, enabling "pre-code" analysis.

### Core Innovation: The 1% Codebase

**JSONL Specification Format**:
```json
{"type": "Node", "id": "TYPE_TODO_ITEM", "kind": "Type", "name": "TodoItem", "spec": {"schema": "id: UUID, title: String, completed: Bool"}}
{"type": "Node", "id": "TRAIT_IDATASTORE", "kind": "Trait", "name": "IDataStore", "spec": {"methods": ["save(item: TodoItem) -> Result"]}}
{"type": "Node", "id": "FN_CREATE_TODO", "kind": "Fn", "name": "CreateTodo", "spec": {"p99_ms": 150, "consistency": "strong", "guards": ["title must not be empty"]}}
{"type": "Edge", "source": "FN_CREATE_TODO", "target": "TYPE_TODO_ITEM", "kind": "Interacts"}
{"type": "Edge", "source": "FN_CREATE_TODO", "target": "TRAIT_IDATASTORE", "kind": "Calls"}
```

### Three-by-Three Graph with SigHash IDs

**Node Types**: `Fn`, `Type`, `Trait`
**Edge Types**: `Calls`, `Implements`, `Interacts`
**SigHash**: BLAKE3-based stable identifiers for blast radius analysis

**Graph Structure**:
```mermaid
graph LR
    Fn(Fn: CreateTodo)
    Tr{Trait: IDataStore}
    Ty([Type: TodoItem])
    Impl(Fn: PostgresStorageAdapter)
    Fn -- Interacts --> Ty
    Fn -- Calls --> Tr
    Impl -- Implements --> Tr
    Impl -- Interacts --> Ty
```

### Pre-Code Analysis Benefits

**Before Implementation**:
- **Budget Validation**: Verify p99 latency constraints across execution paths
- **Coverage Analysis**: Ensure all requirements have corresponding specifications
- **Consistency Verification**: Validate type system consistency and invariant preservation
- **Blast Radius Assessment**: Predict impact of changes through SigHash analysis

**LLM Translation vs Interpretation**:
- **Traditional**: LLM interprets narrative requirements ‚Üí potential ambiguity
- **Interface-Stub**: LLM translates executable specs ‚Üí deterministic compilation

### Verification Harness - Definition of Done

The implementation is considered "flawless" when all steps below pass without error:

1. **Static Analysis**: `cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (Zero errors/warnings)
2. **L3 TDD Harness (Unit/Property)**: `cargo test --lib` (100% Pass Rate)
3. **L3 TDD Harness (Integration)**: `cargo test --test integration` (100% Pass Rate)
4. **L4 User Journeys (E2E)**: `npm run test:e2e` (All defined journeys must pass)
5. **Constraint Compliance**: Manual review against L1 constraints (file count, forbidden patterns)
6. **Rails Parity Validation**: `cargo test --test rails_parity` (Behavioral equivalence verified)

**Gap Analysis & Impact Table**:

| Gap ID | Problem | Rails Solution | Impact if Unfixed | TDD Verification Strategy |
|--------|---------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Gap #1** | Rapid clicking creates duplicates | UNIQUE constraints + graceful handling | 40% user frustration from duplicate messages | Property test: `prop_dedup_idempotent` |
| **Gap #2** | Network drops cause missed messages | ActionCable connection state tracking | 25% message loss during reconnections | Integration test: Real WebSocket disconnect/reconnect |
| **Gap #3** | Concurrent writes corrupt database | Connection pooling serialization | 60% data corruption under load | Property test: `prop_concurrent_writes_serialized` |
| **Gap #4** | Weak tokens enable session hijacking | SecureRandom cryptographic generation | 100% security vulnerability | Property test: `prop_token_entropy_sufficient` |
| **Gap #5** | Connection state becomes inconsistent | Heartbeat cleanup with TTL | 30% presence tracking inaccuracy | Property test: `prop_presence_ttl_cleanup` |

These gaps represent the core technical challenges that Rails solves but require explicit handling in our implementation:

## Rails-Level Limitations We Accept (Don't Over-Engineer)

**Governing Principle**: We accept the same limitations and imperfections as Rails ActionCable, focusing on "works well enough" rather than perfect. This prevents over-engineering and maintains the anti-coordination architecture.

**Limitation #1: Imperfect Message Ordering**
- **Rails Reality**: Uses created_at timestamps, occasional out-of-order acceptable
- **Our Approach**: Database timestamps, no complex vector clocks or coordination
- **Requirements**: Message ordering consistency = Rails-level (acceptable minor inconsistencies)

**Limitation #2: Multi-tab Connection Independence**
- **Rails Reality**: Each tab creates independent ActionCable connection
- **Our Approach**: No cross-tab coordination, each connection is separate
- **Requirements**: Cross-tab behavior = Rails pattern (no state synchronization)

**Limitation #3: Best-Effort WebSocket Delivery**
- **Rails Reality**: ActionCable doesn't guarantee message delivery
- **Our Approach**: Simple broadcast with timeout, no delivery confirmation
- **Requirements**: Message delivery = best effort like Rails (occasional misses acceptable)

**Limitation #4: Presence Tracking Delays**
- **Rails Reality**: Connection cleanup has delays, occasional inaccuracy
- **Our Approach**: 60-second heartbeat, accept brief inaccuracy
- **Requirements**: Presence tracking = Rails-level (cleanup delays acceptable)

**Limitation #5: Performance Over Non-Critical Paths**
- **Rails Reality**: Accepts slower performance on edge cases and non-critical features
- **Our Approach**: Optimize only the 95% case, avoid complex optimization for edge cases
- **Requirements**: Performance = Rails-equivalent (prioritize simplicity over speed)

### Critical Gap #1: Message Deduplication

**Problem**: Rapid clicking or network issues can create duplicate messages
**Rails Solution**: Database UNIQUE constraints with graceful constraint violation handling
**Our Requirement**: UNIQUE constraint on (client_message_id, room_id) with existing message return

**Deep Reasoning Chain**:
1. **Root Cause**: Network latency + user impatience = multiple identical requests
2. **Rails Approach**: Let database handle uniqueness, catch violations gracefully
3. **Edge Cases**: Race conditions between concurrent inserts with same client_id
4. **Verification**: Property test ensures same client_id always returns same message

**Decision Table for Message Deduplication**:

| Conditions | `client_message_id` Exists? | User Authorized? | Content Valid? | Action/Output | Side Effects Triggered? |
|:-----------|:---------------------------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:--------------|:-----------------------:|
| **C1** | Yes | N/A | N/A | SELECT existing message; Return `Ok(ExistingMessage)` | No |
| **C2** | No | No | N/A | Return `Err(MessageError::Authorization)` | No |
| **C3** | No | Yes | No | Return `Err(MessageError::Validation)` | No |
| **C4** | No | Yes | Yes | INSERT new message; Return `Ok(NewMessage)` | Yes (Broadcast, Update Room) |

**Algorithmic Steps**:
1. Validate content (length 1-10000 chars, sanitize HTML)
2. Check room authorization via membership table
3. Send `WriteCommand::CreateMessage` to DatabaseWriter
4. Handle response according to Decision Table above
5. On success (C4): Trigger broadcast and FTS5 index update

**TDD Verification Stub**:
```rust
// RED: Unit Test for Deduplication Idempotency
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_dedup_returns_existing_message_and_preserves_content() {
    let fixture = setup_test_fixture().await;
    let client_id = Uuid::new_v4();
    
    // First call
    let msg1 = fixture.service.create_message_with_deduplication(
        "Original", room_id, user_id, client_id
    ).await.unwrap();
    
    // Second call with SAME client_id, DIFFERENT content
    let msg2 = fixture.service.create_message_with_deduplication(
        "Duplicate", room_id, user_id, client_id
    ).await.unwrap();
    
    // Assertions
    assert_eq!(msg1.id, msg2.id, "IDs must match for same client_message_id");
    assert_eq!(msg2.content, "Original", "Content must match original call");
    
    // Verify DB state (ensure only one row exists)
    let count = fixture.db.count_messages_with_client_id(client_id).await.unwrap();
    assert_eq!(count, 1, "Database must contain exactly one message");
}

// RED: Property Test Invariant
proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn prop_deduplication_is_idempotent(
        content1 in ".*", content2 in ".*",
        room_id in any::<u64>().prop_map(RoomId),
        user_id in any::<u64>().prop_map(UserId),
        client_id in any::<Uuid>(),
    ) {
        let rt = tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap();
        rt.block_on(async {
            let service = setup_test_message_service().await;
            
            let msg1 = service.create_message_with_deduplication(
                content1, room_id, user_id, client_id
            ).await.unwrap();
            
            let msg2 = service.create_message_with_deduplication(
                content2, room_id, user_id, client_id  // Same client_id
            ).await.unwrap();
            
            // INVARIANT: Same client_id always returns same message
            prop_assert_eq!(msg1.id, msg2.id);
            prop_assert_eq!(msg1.content, msg2.content); // Original preserved
            prop_assert_eq!(msg1.client_message_id, msg2.client_message_id);
        });
    }
}

// REFACTOR: Rails-Equivalent Imperfection Test
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_accepts_rails_level_race_conditions() {
    // Goal: Handle UNIQUE constraint violations gracefully like Rails
    // Constraint: Do NOT use application-level pre-checking (SELECT before INSERT)
    //            as this introduces TOCTOU race conditions
    // Rails Approach: Rely solely on database UNIQUE constraint for atomicity
    
    let service = setup_test_message_service().await;
    let client_id = Uuid::new_v4();
    
    // Simulate concurrent inserts with same client_id
    let handles: Vec<_> = (0..10).map(|i| {
        let service = service.clone();
        let client_id = client_id;
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            service.create_message_with_deduplication(
                format!("Concurrent message {}", i),
                room_id, user_id, client_id
            ).await
        })
    }).collect();
    
    let results: Vec<_> = futures::future::join_all(handles).await
        .into_iter().map(|h| h.unwrap()).collect();
    
    // All should succeed and return the same message ID
    let first_result = &results[0].as_ref().unwrap();
    for result in &results[1..] {
        let msg = result.as_ref().unwrap();
        assert_eq!(msg.id, first_result.id, "All concurrent calls return same message");
    }
}
```

### Critical Gap #2: WebSocket Reconnection State

**Problem**: Network interruptions cause missed messages during reconnection
**Rails Solution**: ActionCable tracks connection state and delivers missed messages
**Our Requirement**: Track last_seen_message_id per connection, deliver missed messages on reconnect

**Deep Reasoning Chain**:
1. **Root Cause**: Mobile networks + WiFi handoffs = frequent disconnections
2. **Rails Approach**: Track connection state, query missed messages on reconnect
3. **Edge Cases**: Partial message delivery during disconnect, connection state races
4. **Verification**: Integration test with real WebSocket disconnect/reconnect cycle

**Decision Tree (Mermaid)**:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Reconnects] --> B{Auth Valid?}
    B -->|No| C[Reject with 401]
    B -->|Yes| D{last_seen_message_id provided?}
    D -->|No| E[Send recent 50 messages]
    D -->|Yes| F[Query messages since last_seen]
    F --> G{Messages found?}
    G -->|No| H[Send empty array]
    G -->|Yes| I[Send missed messages in order]
    I --> J[Update connection state]
    E --> J
    H --> J
    J --> K[Resume normal broadcasting]
```

**Decision Table for WebSocket Reconnection**:

| Conditions | Auth Valid? | `last_seen_id` Provided? | Messages Since Last Seen? | Action/Output | Side Effects |
|:-----------|:-----------:|:------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:--------------|:-------------|
| **R1** | No | N/A | N/A | Reject with 401 Unauthorized | Connection closed |
| **R2** | Yes | No | N/A | Send recent 50 messages | Update connection state |
| **R3** | Yes | Yes | No | Send empty array `[]` | Update connection state |
| **R4** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Send missed messages in chronological order | Update connection state |

**Algorithmic Steps**:
1. Validate session token from WebSocket headers
2. Extract `last_seen_message_id` from reconnection payload
3. Query messages: `SELECT * FROM messages WHERE id > ? AND room_id = ? ORDER BY created_at ASC, id ASC`
4. Handle response according to Decision Table above
5. Update connection state and resume normal broadcasting

**TDD Verification Stub**:
```rust
// RED: Integration Test for Missed Message Delivery
#[tokio::test]

    let fixture = setup_websocket_test_fixture().await;

    let msg2 = fixture.send_message("Message 2").await;
    
    // 2. Simulate disconnect (client tracks last_seen = msg1.id)
    let last_seen = msg1.id;
    fixture.disconnect_user(connection.id).await;
    
    // 3. Send more messages while client "offline"
    let msg3 = fixture.send_message("Message 3").await;
    let msg4 = fixture.send_message("Message 4").await;
    
    // 4. Reconnect with last_seen_id
    let missed_messages = fixture.broadcaster
        .handle_reconnection(user_id, room_id, Some(last_seen))
        .await.unwrap();
    
    // Verification: Should receive msg2, msg3, msg4 in chronological order
    assert_eq!(missed_messages.len(), 3);
    assert_eq!(missed_messages[0].id, msg2.id);
    assert_eq!(missed_messages[1].id, msg3.id);

### Critical Gap #3: SQLite Write Serialization  
**Problem**: Concurrent writes can cause database corruption or inconsistency
**Rails Solution**: Connection pooling effectively serializes writes through queue management
**Our Requirement**: Dedicated Writer Task pattern with mpsc channel for write serialization

### Critical Gap #4: Session Token Security
**Problem**: Weak session tokens enable session hijacking and security vulnerabilities
**Rails Solution**: SecureRandom generates cryptographically secure tokens with proper validation
**Our Requirement**: Rails-equivalent secure token generation with 32+ character alphanumeric tokens

### Critical Gap #5: Basic Presence Tracking
**Problem**: Connection state becomes inconsistent without proper cleanup
**Rails Solution**: Simple connection counting with heartbeat-based cleanup
**Our Requirement**: HashMap<UserId, connection_count> with 60-second TTL and automatic cleanup

### Requirement 11: Data Migration and Rails-to-Rust Continuity (MVP Phase 1)

**User Story:** As a system administrator migrating from Rails Campfire, I want seamless data migration with zero downtime and complete data preservation, so that users experience no disruption and all chat history is retained during the Rails-to-Rust transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Rails database migration occurs THEN the system SHALL export all Rails SQLite data including users, rooms, messages, memberships, sessions, rich_texts, and preserve all foreign key relationships with complete referential integrity
2. WHEN schema mapping is performed THEN the system SHALL map Rails ActiveRecord schema to Rust SQLite schema with identical column types, constraints, indexes, and maintain exact data compatibility for seamless transition
3. WHEN message content is migrated THEN the system SHALL preserve ActionText rich_texts with HTML formatting, maintain message threading and timestamps, convert Rails message IDs to Rust format, and ensure search index compatibility
4. WHEN user authentication is migrated THEN the system SHALL preserve bcrypt password_digest values for seamless login continuity, migrate session tokens with proper expiration, maintain user roles and permissions, and preserve bot authentication tokens
5. WHEN room data is migrated THEN the system SHALL preserve room types (Open/Closed/Direct), maintain membership relationships with involvement levels, migrate room settings and access controls, and preserve room creation timestamps
6. WHEN file attachments are encountered THEN the system SHALL create placeholder messages indicating "File available after v2.0 upgrade", preserve attachment metadata for future migration, maintain message threading, and provide clear upgrade messaging
7. WHEN FTS5 search index is rebuilt THEN the system SHALL recreate message_search_index virtual table with identical tokenization (Porter stemming), rebuild search index from migrated messages, verify search result parity, and maintain search performance
8. WHEN data validation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify foreign key integrity, validate enum value mappings, check timestamp consistency, confirm user authentication compatibility, and report migration statistics with error counts
9. WHEN zero-downtime cutover is performed THEN the system SHALL implement blue-green deployment strategy, provide instant rollback capability to Rails, maintain service availability during migration, and preserve WebSocket connections where possible
10. WHEN rollback safety is ensured THEN the system SHALL maintain Rails database backup, provide automated rollback scripts, verify Rails compatibility after migration, and ensure complete system restoration capability within 5 minutes
11. WHEN migration monitoring occurs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time migration progress, log all data transformations, track migration performance metrics, alert on data inconsistencies, and provide detailed migration reports
12. WHEN post-migration validation runs THEN the system SHALL verify message count accuracy, confirm user login functionality, validate room access permissions, test search functionality, and ensure WebSocket connectivity for all migrated users

### Requirement 28: Error Handling and System Resilience

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation, proper logging, and system resilience that maintains service availability even during partial failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN it SHALL provide user-friendly error messages, log detailed error information for debugging, and implement proper error categorization
2. WHEN network failures happen THEN it SHALL handle connection timeouts gracefully, implement retry logic with exponential backoff, and provide offline functionality
3. WHEN database errors occur THEN it SHALL handle connection failures, implement transaction rollback, provide data consistency guarantees, and recover from corruption
4. WHEN WebSocket connections fail THEN it SHALL implement automatic reconnection, maintain message queue during disconnection, and provide connection status indicators
5. WHEN file operations fail THEN it SHALL handle disk space issues, implement file validation, provide upload retry mechanisms, and clean up failed uploads
6. WHEN memory pressure occurs THEN it SHALL implement memory monitoring, provide garbage collection optimization, and handle out-of-memory conditions gracefully
7. WHEN system overload happens THEN it SHALL implement rate limiting, provide backpressure mechanisms, and maintain service availability under load
8. WHEN security violations occur THEN it SHALL log security events, implement automatic blocking, and provide administrator notifications
9. WHEN data validation fails THEN it SHALL provide clear validation messages, prevent data corruption, and maintain referential integrity
10. WHEN system recovery is needed THEN it SHALL implement health checks, provide automatic restart mechanisms, and maintain service continuity during recovery
