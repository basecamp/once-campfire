# Campfire Rust Rewrite - Architecture Document

## ⚠️ Critical Database Deployment Rule

**NEVER INCLUDE DATABASE FILES IN CONTAINER IMAGES**

### Why This Rule Exists:
- **Data Loss Risk**: Container updates/restarts can wipe database
- **No Persistence**: Accidental container deletion = complete data loss  
- **Backup Impossible**: Can't backup database independently
- **Scaling Issues**: Can't run multiple instances
- **Recovery Problems**: Must restore entire container for data recovery

### Correct Deployment Approach:
```dockerfile
# ✅ CORRECT: No database in image
FROM alpine:latest
COPY campfire-rust /usr/local/bin/campfire-rust
# Database will be in mounted volume or persistent filesystem
EXPOSE $PORT
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/campfire-rust"]
```

### Deployment Strategies by Platform:
- **Docker/VPS**: Use volume mounts (`-v campfire-data:/data`)
- **Railway/Render**: Use persistent filesystem (`/app/data/`)
- **AWS/GCP**: Use managed volumes (EFS/Persistent Disks)
- **Kubernetes**: Use PersistentVolumeClaims

## Critical Coordination Mechanisms

**Based on Cynical Analysis**: The architecture has been redesigned to address 47 critical coordination gaps that would prevent the system from working correctly on first deployment.

### 1. Atomic Coordination Message Flow
```

  │                        │                          │                        │
  ├─ Optimistic UI ────────┤                          │                        │
  │  (show pending)        │                          │                        │
  │                        │                          │                        │
  │                        ├─ Atomic Transaction ────▶│                        │
  │                        │  (msg + room + unread)   │                        │
  │                        │                          │                        │

```

### 2. Coordination-First State Management
- **Global Event Sequencing**: All events get sequence numbers to prevent out-of-order delivery
- **Atomic State Transitions**: Multi-step operations use coordinated transactions with compensation
- **Connection State Coordination**: WebSocket connections established atomically with presence tracking
- **Cross-Tab Coordination**: Browser tabs elect leader to prevent duplicate WebSocket connections
- **Recovery Coordination**: State synchronization on reconnection with missed event replay

### 3. Database Coordination Patterns
- **Write Coordination**: SQLite WAL mode with single-writer semaphore to prevent contention
- **Transaction Boundaries**: Clear separation between atomic database operations and external effects
- **FTS5 Coordination**: Asynchronous search index updates with eventual consistency guarantees
- **Connection Pooling**: Coordinated database access with priority queuing for critical operations

### 4. Real-time Coordination Architecture
- **Room-Level Coordinators**: Each room has dedicated coordinator for atomic state management
- **Presence Coordination**: Atomic connection counting with heartbeat-based cleanup
- **Typing Coordination**: Throttled notifications with automatic cleanup for abandoned sessions
- **Message Ordering**: Global sequence numbers ensure consistent message ordering across clients

### 5. Fault Tolerance and Recovery Coordination
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures with automatic recovery detection
- **Retry Coordination**: Exponential backoff with persistent queues for failed operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with reduced functionality during partial failures
- **State Recovery**: Comprehensive recovery mechanisms for network partitions and server restarts

## Performance Targets

### MVP Phase 1 Targets (Coordination-Aware)
- **Memory**: 30-60MB total (includes coordination overhead, retry queues, event logs)
- **Connections**: 500+ concurrent WebSocket (realistic with coordination overhead)
- **Startup**: <500ms cold start (includes coordination setup and state recovery)
- **Throughput**: 1K+ req/sec sustainable (with full coordination and retry mechanisms)
- **Storage**: 20MB-500MB (text-only + coordination metadata + event logs)
- **Cost Reduction**: 85-90% vs Rails (coordination adds overhead but still significant savings)

### Response Time Targets (Coordination-Realistic)
- **API Calls**: <50ms (includes coordination overhead and atomic operations)
- **Message Operations**: <200ms (optimistic UI + coordination + retry logic)
- **Static Assets**: <5ms (includes coordination health checks)
- **WebSocket Messages**: <20ms routing (includes sequencing and state coordination)
- **Database Queries**: <20ms (includes coordination locks and transaction overhead)

### Reliability Targets (Coordination-Validated)
- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime (43.8 hours downtime per year, realistic for coordination complexity)
- **Message Delivery**: 99.9% success rate (with coordination and retry mechanisms)
- **Data Consistency**: 99.99% (atomic coordination prevents most corruption)
- **Recovery Time**: <60 seconds for coordination re-establishment
- **State Sync**: <10 seconds for full WebSocket reconnection with state recovery

### Scalability Limits (Coordination-Constrained)
- **Single Room**: 100 concurrent users (coordination overhead limits scalability)
- **Total Rooms**: 50 active rooms (coordination memory and processing limits)
- **Message Rate**: 50 messages/second system-wide (coordination bottleneck)
- **Coordination Queue**: 5,000 pending operations maximum
- **Event Log**: 50MB maximum before oldest events are discarded

**Note**: These targets reflect the realistic overhead of proper coordination mechanisms. The trade-off is lower raw performance for significantly higher reliability and consistency.

## Feature Flag Architecture

### Configuration-Driven Feature Control
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct FeatureFlags {
    pub files_enabled: bool,        // MVP: false
    pub avatars_enabled: bool,      // MVP: false  
    pub opengraph_enabled: bool,    // MVP: false
    pub max_file_size: usize,       // MVP: 0
    pub search_enabled: bool,       // MVP: true
    pub push_notifications: bool,   // MVP: true
    pub bot_integrations: bool,     // MVP: true
}

impl Default for FeatureFlags {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            files_enabled: false,
            avatars_enabled: false,
            opengraph_enabled: false,
            max_file_size: 0,
            search_enabled: true,
            push_notifications: true,
            bot_integrations: true,
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This **coordination-first architecture** provides the optimal balance of **reliability**, **complete user experience**, and **significant cost reduction**. By addressing the 47 critical coordination gaps identified in the cynical analysis, we achieve:

1. **Production-ready reliability** through comprehensive coordination mechanisms
2. **Professional appearance** with complete UI and graceful feature degradation
3. **85-90% cost reduction** (realistic with coordination overhead)
4. **Proven coordination patterns** that work under real-world failure conditions
5. **Clear evolution path** with battle-tested coordination for future features

**Key Insight**: The original analysis revealed that the challenge is not implementing individual features, but ensuring they work together reliably. This architecture prioritizes **coordination over raw performance**, resulting in a system that actually works in production rather than just in demos.

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Lower raw performance (1K vs 15K req/sec) for higher reliability
- Higher memory usage (30-60MB vs 10-30MB) for coordination overhead
- More complex implementation for production-grade fault tolerance

The approach eliminates the common MVP problem of "works in demo but fails in production" while maintaining significant cost benefits over the Rails implementation. Users get a reliable, professional chat experience that continues working under real-world conditions including network issues, concurrent usage, and partial failures.

- **Memory Usage**: Total memory, retry queue size, fallback storage usage

### Alerting Thresholds
- **Message Failure Rate**: >1% (indicates system issues)
- **WebSocket Reconnection Rate**: >10% (network or server issues)
- **Database Query Latency**: >50ms average (performance degradation)
- **Circuit Breaker Open**: Any circuit open for >5 minutes
- **Memory Usage**: >80% of allocated memory

### Fault Tolerance Validation
- **Recovery Time**: <30 seconds for component failures
