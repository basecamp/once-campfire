# Campfire Rust Rewrite - Analysis Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of analyzing the existing Ruby on Rails Campfire application to validate and enhance the requirements document for the Rust rewrite project.

## Analysis Methodology

### Approach
- Systematic examination of the Rails codebase structure
- Validation of requirements against actual implementation
- Identification of gaps and missing functionality
- Assessment of technical complexity and implementation details

### Files Examined
- **Core Models**: User, Room, Message, Account
- **Database Schema**: Initial migration with 12+ tables
- **Real-time Features**: ActionCable channels (Room, Presence, TypingNotifications)
- **Bot Integration**: Webhook system, authentication, API handling
- **File Processing**: Active Storage, attachment handling, thumbnail generation
- **Push Notifications**: WebPush implementation with thread pools
- **Search System**: FTS5 full-text search with Porter stemming
- **Frontend Controllers**: Messages and Composer Stimulus controllers
- **Sound System**: 50+ predefined sounds with text/image responses

   - VIPS image processing
   - Video preview generation as WebP

5. **Push Notification Infrastructure**
   - WebPush with VAPID keys

   - Subscription lifecycle management
   - Payload structure with title, body, path, badge

6. **Authentication & Security**
   - Session-based authentication
   - bcrypt password hashing
   - Rate limiting (10 attempts per 3 minutes)
   - CSRF protection with bot API bypass

### ❌ Missing or Underrepresented Areas

#### 1. Frontend JavaScript Complexity
**Gap**: Requirements mention "Stimulus parity" but don't capture sophisticated client-side models

**Missing Details**:
- **MessageFormatter**: Threading logic with 5-minute windows, emoji detection, mention highlighting
- **MessagePaginator**: Intersection observers, excess message trimming, loading states
- **ScrollManager**: Auto-scroll thresholds (100px), keep-scroll positioning, pending operation queuing
- **ClientMessage**: Template rendering, state management, UUID generation
- **FileUploader**: Progress tracking with XMLHttpRequest, visual feedback systems

**Impact**: High - These are critical for user experience parity

#### 2. Content Filtering Pipeline
**Gap**: Sophisticated content processing system not documented

**Missing Components**:
- `ContentFilters::RemoveSoloUnfurledLinkText`
- `ContentFilters::StyleUnfurledTwitterAvatars`
- `ContentFilters::SanitizeTags`
- ActionText content processing with custom filters
- HTML sanitization and XSS prevention

**Impact**: Medium - Important for security and content presentation

#### 3. OpenGraph Implementation Details
**Gap**: Requirements mention OpenGraph but miss critical security and processing details

**Missing Details**:
- `RestrictedHTTP::PrivateNetworkGuard` for SSRF protection
- Complex metadata extraction with Nokogiri
- Document parsing and validation
- Security restrictions and timeout handling
- Image URL validation and caching

**Impact**: High - Security-critical functionality

#### 4. Advanced Membership Management
**Gap**: Membership system more sophisticated than described

**Missing Features**:
- Connection counting and presence state tracking
- Complex involvement level scoping and filtering
- Batch operations (`grant_to`, `revoke_from`, `revise`)
- Automatic membership management for room types
- Performance optimizations for large user sets

**Impact**: Medium - Affects scalability and user experience

#### 5. Message Threading and Positioning
**Gap**: Complex message ordering and threading logic not captured

**Missing Logic**:
- 5-minute threading windows with precise timing
- Message positioning algorithms
- Sort value calculations
- Thread style management
- First-of-day detection with separators

**Impact**: High - Core chat experience functionality

#### 6. Performance Optimization Patterns
**Gap**: Rails-specific optimizations that need Rust equivalents

**Missing Patterns**:
- Efficient SQL queries with proper indexing strategies
- Connection pooling and prepared statement usage
- Turbo Stream broadcasting optimizations
- Asset pipeline and caching mechanisms
- Memory management for large message sets

**Impact**: High - Critical for performance goals
