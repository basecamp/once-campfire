# Implementation Plan - Campfire Rust Rewrite MVP 1.0

## IMPORTANT FOR VISUALS AND DIAGRAMS

ALL DIAGRAMS WILL BE IN MERMAID ONLY TO ENSURE EASE WITH GITHUB - DO NOT SKIP THAT

## Overview

**Strategic Focus**: Build complete text-based Campfire functionality using Rails-equivalent patterns in idiomatic Rust, prioritizing working software over architectural innovation.

**Core Philosophy**: 
- **Rails Parity Rule**: If Rails doesn't do it, we don't do it - replicate Rails patterns exactly using idiomatic Rust
- **Anti-Coordination Mandates**: No coordination layers, event buses, or distributed complexity
- **Single Binary Deployment**: Embedded assets using Rust's compile-time inclusion
- **Type Safety First**: Leverage Rust's type system to prevent bugs at compile-time

**Gap #2: WebSocket Reconnection State** - Track last_seen_message_id per connection ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED  
**Gap #3: SQLite Write Serialization** - Dedicated Writer Task pattern with mpsc channel ‚ùå PENDING

- Single binary deployment works with embedded assets
- WebSocket real-time messaging functions correctly
- All 5 critical gaps are solved and tested
- Rails behavioral parity achieved for core features
- HTTP API endpoints work with proper authentication
- Room management system functions correctly

## Next Priority Tasks

1. **Session Extraction Middleware** (Task 1.4) - Essential for API authentication
2. **Complete Authentication Handlers** (Task 1.5) - Required for user login/logout
3. **Complete Room Service** (Task 2.2) - Required for room management
4. **Room API Endpoints** (Task 2.3) - Essential for room operations
5. **Message API Endpoints** (Task 3.3) - Critical for message functionality
6. **Database Writer Pattern** (Task 3.4) - Critical Gap #3 implementation

## Implementation Notes

**Current State**: The core services (AuthService, MessageService, ConnectionManager) are fully implemented with comprehensive tests. The database schema is complete with all necessary tables and constraints. The main remaining work is:

1. **HTTP API Integration**: Connect the implemented services to HTTP handlers
2. **Room Management**: Complete the RoomService implementation 
3. **WebSocket Integration**: Connect the ConnectionManager to actual WebSocket handlers
4. **Write Serialization**: Implement Critical Gap #3 for SQLite write safety

**Architecture Status**: The foundation is solid with proper error handling, type safety, and Rails-equivalent patterns. The remaining tasks focus on integration and completing the user-facing API.
